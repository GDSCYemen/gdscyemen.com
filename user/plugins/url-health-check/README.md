# YOURLS-URL-Health-Check
A YOURLS plugin that checks submitted URL's for validity, reachability, and redirection

- If a submitted URL does not meet [RFC 2396](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html) standards, it is rejected
- If a submitted http(s) URL is unreachable (times out after 3 seconds), it is rejected
- If a submitted http(s) URL is a redirect, the final destination is stored to avoid nested redirects

### Requirements
- A working [YOURLS](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS) installation
- php-curl installed and activated

### INSTALLATION

1. Place the url-health-check folder in YOURLS/user/plugins/
2. Activate in the Admin interface

### TODO

- Make timeout limit adjustable
- Check old links for reachability?
